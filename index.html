      <h1>Brushes O' Brushes</h1>
      <p>This interface allows the user to draw what they want. With five different colors to pick from, each color allows the user to interact with a type  of brush too. This is similar to macpaint, or any painting app, however four of the five brushes are no normal tools.</p>
